I applied my knowledge of HTML and CSS based on a web layout, I learned a lot developing this project and I am proud to have been able to finish it, I know that the project has several possible errors for those who are more experienced, But with 2 months of studies I'm extremely happy, I'll soon surpass myself again and create another project at the same level, but adding JS.
