I applied my knowledge of HTML and CSS based on a web layout, I learned a lot developing this project and I am proud to have been able to finish it, I know that the project has several possible errors for those who are more experienced, But with 2 months of studies I'm extremely happy, I'll soon surpass myself again and create another project at the same level, but adding JS.


HTML - In this project I believe I excelled in the organization of divs and sections, It was also the first time that I used most of the semantic html TAGS, I hesitated a lot when naming the classes.

CSS - During the development of this project I improved my knowledge of FlexBox a lot, I had just learned to use it and could only do some very basic things, It was a great experience, I feel super confident now in creating any layout from FlexBox .
